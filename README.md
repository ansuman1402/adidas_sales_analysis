# Adidas Sales Analysis

As I started exploring my career in Data Analysis, I came across various terminologies and some small projects.
This repository is a small EDA and Visualization project that I carried out.

## About the project

This project folder contains three files:-
1. The Excel Dataset (.xlsx)
2. Power BI Visualization (.pbix)
3. EDA done (.ipynb)

### Problem Statement:-
The Adidas Merchandise management wants to know the post-pandemic sales insight, as the pandemic has become a part of our life and the management is looking for 
some valuable findings, their MVP that sold the most, and some of the weak categories upon which they have to focus the most. 


## Starting Points:-
1. We start digging with the total revenue generated, with the total units sold.

2. We look for the top revenue-generating cities/states, with the most sold product.
3. We will also look for the buying pattern, and the most bought product by men/women.

## Goal of the project:-
To present with as much insight as can be delivered from the dataset provided.
