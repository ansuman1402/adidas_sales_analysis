# Adidas Sales Analysis

As I started exploring my career in Data Analysis, I came along the various terminologies and some of the small projects.
This repository is a small EDA and Visualization project that has been carried out by myself.

## About the project

This project folder contains three files:-
1. The Excel Dataset (.xlsx)
2. Power BI Visualization (.pbix)
3. EDA done (.ipynb)

### Problem Statement :-
The Adidas Merchandise management want to know the post pandemic sales insight, as the pandemic has become the part of our life and the management is looking for 
some valuable findings and their MVP that sold the most and also some of the weak categories upon which they have to focus the most.
